# EEPROM_SAMPLE_PLAYER

This project is my first attempt at reading and writting data to a EEPROM. The EEPROM countais a variety of 8bit samples(These are created using a Python script that will be attached soon).
The data stored in the EEPROM are accessed using two shift registers (SIPO). The output of the memroy are read directly.
The audio implementation is (for now) based on the Auduino code, as I'm still wrapping my head around audio generation with uC.

By all mean, this is a first prototype, and for sure will need refinement.
